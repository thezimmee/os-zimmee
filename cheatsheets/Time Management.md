1. Know exactly what your work is.

2. Break it down.
    
    There are three types of work, each which should be handled differently:

    1. _One-time tasks_. Schedule these _tomorrow_, the day after you list them, unless it must be done today.
    2. _Recurring tasks_. Do these when it suits you.
    3. _Projects_. Do one at a time, if possible. Focus on finishing one before starting the next.

3. Prioritize. Avoid prioritizing by letters/numbers, because that ensures some categories of tasks will generally be ignored. Start by prioritizing things that are deadline driven.
