## Building apps with vanilla JS

### Libraries vs Frameworks

Apps can contain any combination of libraries and/or frameworks.

**Libraries**

- Import into codebase.
- Organize app code however you like.
- Libraries fit into your app by making calls to its APIs.
- App calls the library.
- Can be more easily replaced than frameworks, because libraries are small, focused functional pieces.

**Frameworks**

- Requires a structure prescribed by the framework.
- App must be built around the framework.
- Framework calls your app.
- Difficult task to replace a framework.
