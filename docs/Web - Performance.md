# Web Performance

## JS performance

-   When choosing third-party resources, favor those that send the least amount of code while still giving you the functionality you need.
-   Use [performance budgets](https://web.dev/use-lighthouse-for-performance-budgets/) for third-party content to keep their cost in check.
-   Don't use the same functionality from two different vendors. You probably don't need two tag managers or two analytics platforms.
-   Routinely audit and clean out redundant third-party scripts.
